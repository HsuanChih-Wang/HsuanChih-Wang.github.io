* I was in charge of designing and implementing core signal priority strategies for 21 signalized intersections.
* Led a group in developing a traffic simulation in SUMO to evaluate traffic impact; the complete evaluation results were presented at the 2022 SUMO User Conference.
    * Chun-Cheng Liang, **Hsuan-Chih Wang***, Wei-Hsun Lee and Ming-Te Wang (2022). Evaluating traffic performance of transit signal priority using SUMO simulation: A real-world case. _2022 SUMO Conference_ .

* The project received the *Highest Distinction Award* and *Outstanding Transportation Project Award* out of 20+ ITS projects in Taiwan from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Chinese Institute of Transportation, respectively

### A Person-Based Adaptive Traffic Signal Control Method with Cooperative Transit Signal Priority (Master's thesis)

* In my master's thesis, I proposed a Person-based Adaptive traffic signal control method with Cooperative Transit signal priority (PACT). In PACT, not only do Road-Side Units (RSUs) perform signal optimization, but also On-Board Units (OBUs) provide in-vehicle speed advisory to reduce delays. The interaction between RSU and OBU is conducted second-by-second, which has high adaptability to traffic variations.
