* I was in charge of designing and implementing core signal priority strategies for 21 signalized intersections.
* Led a group in developing a traffic simulation in SUMO to evaluate traffic impact; the complete evaluation results were presented at the 2022 SUMO User Conference.
    * Chun-Cheng Liang, **Hsuan-Chih Wang***, Wei-Hsun Lee and Ming-Te Wang (2022). Evaluating traffic performance of transit signal priority using SUMO simulation: A real-world case. _2022 SUMO Conference_ .
